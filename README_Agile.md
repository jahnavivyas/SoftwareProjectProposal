Title:
College Buy/Sell

What and why?
I would like to build a web application for students at universities who are trying to buy and sell school-related items to each other, including textbooks, supplies, dorm furnishing, and clothes. This is important as many students currently rely on Facebook pages which are open to the public, which compromise their safety when interacting with group members. 

For whom?
This software is for college students, who will be able to access their university's marketplace with their student email. This can ensure that the application's usage is limited to students and alumni of the university.

How?
Students will be able to search by category of what they are looking to buy or sell, and can message the buyer/seller directly to discuss the price and the exchange of the goods. Pictures must be supplied in order to sell anything, and buyers are able to view these pictures and potentially place bids, comment, etc.

Scope
This proposal is nor too easy nor too ambitious as it is scaled for small communities of several thousands of people, but has many functionalities built in for the users.
